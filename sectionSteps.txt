Flutter Themes:
way to define custom look & feel and custom color palette
https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/themes

Create app theme to share styling and color across app
-> needs ThemeData Widget

1. Create an overall material theme
2. Delete and use DarkTheme override .copyWith to use DarkTheme but change a few apsects
3. Sample FlatButton local override Theme by wrapping FlatButton in Theme Widget
4. Comment out FlatButton as no longer needed

5. separate screens into different files:
5.1 create file "input_page.dart"
5.2 cut & paste Input Page Stateful Widget from main.dart -> input_page.dart
5.3 add input_page.dart as import to main.dart

6. Create Cards
6.1 delete content of scaffold on input_page
6.2 add body Container, Color (0xFF1D1E33), height 200, width 170, margin (all) 15, borderradius via decoration property - > need to move Color to decoration so it doesn't crash!
6.3. delete height and width and replace with expanded widgets
6.4 as there are many repeats - Refactor code -> extract containers with "extract widget" from FLutter Outline - delete new (deprecated)
6.5 delete constr of new class   const ReusableCard({ Key key, }) : super(key: key);
6.6 create own constructor
6.7 create property colour and make it a @required prop
6.8. add required props in all calls
6.9. add pin container as "Button" at the bottom within Column children[]
6.10 add constants at the top for easier access - bottomContainerHeight and replace height
6.11 add const activeCardColor at the top for init and replace params at obj instantiation
6.12 add const bottomContainerColour at the top for init and replace params at obj instantiation

7. L116 - Create custom Flutter Widget
7.1 create custom child property called cardChild in ReusableCard class and add to constr
7.2 add child: CardChild to Container of class to make it passable to class

8. add text to cards:
8.1 get font_awesome_flutter package from pub.dev
8.2 add cardChild to first container with Icon mars (male) and Text "Male"
STOP APP and run from SCRATCH (= cold restart)! whenever you do package get in pubspec.yaml
8.3 add MainAxisAlignment.center to Column to center info on cardChild
8.4 extract Column with all props into separate class IconContent, add props IconData (cardIcon) & Text and constr, change Text & Icon in IconContent class to reflect these changes
(replace FontAwesome.mars with cardIcon (all of it incl. FontAwesome!)
8.5 separate IconContent & Reusable Card into sep files (icon_content.dart &  reusable_card.dart
8.6 create const for height & size in icon_content.dart
8.6a labelTextstyle

9. L-117 GestureDector Widget - make iconCards interactive
9.1 - 2 options: wrap ReusableCard in FlatButton (changes styling -use if material button is needed) or GestureDetector (used here to keep styling) - wrap in Gesture Detector, add onTap
9.2 change color of male & female card on tap
    9.2a create const for inactive Color,
    9.2b init Male & Female Card with new params (maleCardColour and femaleCardColour) within state class
    9.2c change colour prop of male and female card to maleCardColour and femaleCardColour
    9.2d create method updateColour()
    9.2e update onTap with setState(updateColour(gender))
    9.2f switch off other male/female active colour

10. L-118 Enums: replace int Gender with enum Gender
10.1 add enum Gender at top (enums cannot be in classes, no ; at the end!!
10.2 a,b&c update if statement in updateColour()
10.3 a&b update setState() | updateColour() methodcalls for male & female
