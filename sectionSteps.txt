Flutter Themes:
way to define custom look & feel and custom color palette
https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/themes

Create app theme to share styling and color across app
-> needs ThemeData Widget

1. Create an overall material theme
2. Delete and use DarkTheme override .copyWith to use DarkTheme but change a few apsects
3. Sample FlatButton local override Theme by wrapping FlatButton in Theme Widget
4. Comment out FlatButton as no longer needed

5. separate screens into different files:
5.1 create file "input_page.dart"
5.2 cut & paste Input Page Stateful Widget from main.dart -> input_page.dart
5.3 add input_page.dart as import to main.dart

6. Create Cards
6.1 delete content of scaffold on input_page
6.2 add body Container, Color (0xFF1D1E33), height 200, width 170, margin (all) 15, borderradius via decoration property - > need to move Color to decoration so it doesn't crash!
6.3. delete height and width and replace with expanded widgets
6.4 as there are many repeats - Refactor code -> extract containers with "extract widget" from FLutter Outline - delete new (deprecated)
6.5 delete constr of new class   const ReusableCard({ Key key, }) : super(key: key);
6.6 create own constructor
6.7 create property colour and make it a @required prop
6.8. add required props in all calls
